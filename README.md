# Caesar Cipher in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that implements the Caesar cipher.

The program demonstrates:
- Encryption of text using a fixed shift (key = 3)
- Decryption of the encrypted text
- Handling of both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Use of modular arithmetic for wrap-around

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand character manipulation and basic encryption logic in C++.
